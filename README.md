# Orthopedic Patient Classification and Bank Marketing Prediction

This repository contains two machine learning projects:

## 1. Orthopedic Patient Classification

### Objective
Develop ML models to classify orthopedic patients based on biomechanical features of the pelvis and lumbar spine.

### Data
- 6 biomechanical attributes
- 3 classes: Normal, Disc Hernia, Spondylolisthesis

### Key Steps
1. Data Understanding: Read and analyze 3 CSV files
2. Data Preparation: Unify class labels, combine datasets
3. Data Analysis: Visualize correlations and distributions
4. Model Building: Train KNN classifier
5. Performance Improvement: Optimize model parameters

## 2. Bank Marketing Prediction

### Objective
Predict potential customers who will convert to loan products using historical data.

### Data
- Customer demographics and banking behavior
- Target variable: LoanOnCard

### Key Steps
1. Data Preparation: Merge datasets, handle data types
2. Data Exploration: Analyze target variable distribution
3. Model Building: Train Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models
4. Performance Improvement: Balance data, tune parameters

Both projects demonstrate data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model development for classification tasks.
